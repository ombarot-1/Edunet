This tool enables you to hide a secret message within an image using pixel manipulation. By entering a message and a passcode, the program encrypts the message and stores it in the imageâ€™s pixel values. To decrypt, simply provide the correct passcode, and the hidden message will be revealed. The modified image is saved as `encryptedImage.jpg`. This tool requires Python and the OpenCV library for execution.
